kotti_fruits_example
====================

An example Kotti project using a dataset about fruits, containing images from
Wikipedia.

TODO:

- Is the setup for populate in __init__.py what you would do in the current
  Kotti? (this project was copied from an early version)

- The call to kotti.populate() is done at the top of the project populate().
  Same question -- correct procedure?

- FruitCategoriesFolder is added to the root document. Should it be added to
  root instead?

- Views are likely in need of updating or writing correctly, because the views
  in the project are bare skeletons.

- How to load the images? Need an Image type? Coordinate with/program for
  tinymce?
